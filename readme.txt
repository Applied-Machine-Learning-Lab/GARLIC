This is a simplified version of the code with a complete process. When expanding the experiment to the Hangzhou dataset, the parameters of the GPT model we used are larger. Due to privacy restrictions and the Data Security Law of the People's Republic of China, the Hangzhou dataset cannot be fully disclosed until it is completely de-anonymized. Please stay tuned.
